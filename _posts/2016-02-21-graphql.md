### GraphQl

GraphQl is a data query and data manipulation language for client applications.GraphQL is an application layer query language from Facebook. GrpahQl is not tied with a database. With GraphQL, you can define your backend as a well-defined graph-based schema. Then client applications can query your dataset as they are needed.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### contd...

We don't need to change our backend for data requirement changes in client apps. This simply solves one of the biggest problems in managing REST API.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### contd...

GraphQL is a specification so, it can be used with any platform and any language. It has a reference implementation on JavaScript, maintained by Facebook.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### What problems does GraphQl try to solve

* Client-side developers should have a way to ask for the data they need.
* Server-side developers should have a way to expose the data they have.
* There should be an easy and efficient way to query data (the REST API consumes a lot of resources, especially with mobile apps).

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### We will see how Graphql works


At the heart of any GraphQL implementation is a description of what types of objects it can return, described in a GraphQL type system and returned in the GraphQL Schema.

  ```type Student {
  name: String
}```

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### contd ...

  A common pattern in many APIs, and indeed in GraphQL is to give objects an ID that can be used to refetch the object.

  ```type Student {
  id: String
  name: String
}```


</section>

<section data-markdown>
### contd...

  Now thing in this particular school there are only 8th 9th and 10th standard.
  So we have to define an enum for standard

  ```enum Standard { 8th, 9th, 10th}```

  Now we will add a field to Student describing what standard they are in.

  ```type Student {
  id: String
  name: String
  appearsIn: [standard]
}```

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Graphql

  When we define a schema, we define an object type that is the basis for all queries. The name of this type is Query by convention, and it describes our public, top-level API. Our Query type for this example will look like this:

  ```type Query {
  student(id: String!): Student
}```

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Query syntax

An example query on the above schema would be:

  ```query StudentNameQuery {
  student {
    name
  }
}```

The initial line, query StudentNameQuery, defines a query with the operation name StudentNameQuery that starts with the schema's root query type; in this case, Query.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### contd...

The result of this query would then be:

  ```{
  "student": {
    "name": "R2-D2"
  }
}```


</section>

<section data-markdown>
  ### contd...

  One of the key aspects of GraphQL is its ability to nest queries.

  ```
    query NestedQuery {
      student{
        name
        friends {
          name
          appearsIn
          friends {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
  ### contd...

  ```
    {
      "student": {
        "name": "Ram",
        "friends": [
          {
            "name": "Luke",
            "appearsIn": [ "8th" ],
            "friends": [
              { "name": "Han" },
              { "name": "Leia" },
              { "name": "Krishna" },
              { "name": "Mujeeb" }
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "Han",
            "appearsIn": [ "10th" ],
            "friends": [
              { "name": "Luke" },
              { "name": "Lei Organa" },
              { "name": "Neethu" }
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "Leia",
            "appearsIn": [ "8th" ],
            "friends": [
              { "name": "Luke" },
              { "name": "Han" }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ```
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### contd...

The Query type above defined a way to fetch a student given their ID. We can use it by hardcoding the ID in the query:

  ```
    query FetchLukeQuery {
      student(id: "1000") {
        name
      }
    }
  ```
to get

  ```
    {
      "student": {
        "name": "Luke Skywalker"
      }
    }
  ```

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Drawbacks

It misses the ability to update clients reactively. In the GraphQL spec, there is no way to subscribe and get updates. Right now, to achieve real-time updates, we need to poll the server and get the changes.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Setup

Make a demo folder

  ```
    mkdir graphql-demo
    cd graphql-demo
  ```
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### contd...

We have to install 3 packages

* graphql, the reference implementation of GraphQL in JS

* express, a basic web framework.

* express-graphql, middleware for express to make it easy to expose a GraphQL server.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### contd...

Install 3 packages

  ```
    npm init -f
    npm install graphql --save
    npm install express --save
    npm install express-graphql --save
  ```
