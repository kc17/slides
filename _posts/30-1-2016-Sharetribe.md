### pros and cons for building with a Sharetribe backend
Cons
* Sharetribe is a tool that is useful for certain purposes, but using it for others might do more harm than good.
* As a developer, it's often more fun to start from scratch than to learn an entire complex platform and start extending it.
* There might be lots of features that you actually don't want to have, which might be a distraction. If you build your own thing, you get to only build the features you want, which makes development easier, as you avoid complexity.
