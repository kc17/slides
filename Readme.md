==============


At [Red Panthers](http://redpanthers.co), we always wanted to create a culture of continuous learning, innovation and delivery. We thrive to better ourselves, our craftsmanship, technical skills by learning new languages, frameworks, technology, methodologies that would help us to improve efficiency and productivity. Often we conduct technical talks/sessions
sharing the knowledge we gained with the team members. We have benefitted from the open source community, and we believe that its our responsibility to share the knowledge that was once passed to us. We will be using this space to host our slides of our talks.
